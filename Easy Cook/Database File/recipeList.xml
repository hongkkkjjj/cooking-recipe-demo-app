            <ingredient>½ tablespoon olive oil</ingredient>
            <ingredient>1 cup diced onion</ingredient>
            <ingredient>½ cup diced carrot</ingredient>
            <ingredient>½ cup diced celery</ingredient>
            <ingredient>1 bay leaf</ingredient>
            <ingredient>4 cups low-sodium chicken broth</ingredient>
            <ingredient>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs</ingredient>
            <ingredient>1 pound bone-in chicken breasts, skin removed</ingredient>
            <ingredient>½ teaspoon thyme (Optional)</ingredient>
            <ingredient>½ teaspoon dried marjoram</ingredient>
            <ingredient>1 teaspoon salt (Optional)</ingredient>
            <ingredient>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</ingredient>
            <ingredient>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</ingredient>
            <ingredient>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</ingredient>
            <ingredient>salt and ground black pepper to taste (Optional)</ingredient>
            <ingredient>½ cup frozen petite peas</ingredient>
            <ingredient>½ cup frozen cut green beans</ingredient>
            <ingredient>1 cup all-purpose flour</ingredient>
            <ingredient>1 teaspoon baking powder</ingredient>
            <ingredient>½ teaspoon salt (Optional)</ingredient>
            <ingredient>2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter</ingredient>
            <ingredient>1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</ingredient>
            <ingredient>½ cup buttermilk</ingredient>
        </ingredients>
        <steps>
            <step>Pour the olive oil into a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as an Instant Pot®) and select the Saute function. Cook onion, carrot, celery, and bay leaf until the vegetables are soft and the onion has turned translucent, about 5 minutes.</step>
            <step>Add chicken broth, chicken thighs, chicken breasts, thyme, marjoram, salt, and pepper. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 9 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</step>
            <step>Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Carefully remove the chicken pieces with tongs and place them in a bowl to cool slightly; discard bay leaf.</step>
            <step>Mash butter with the flour to make a smooth paste; set aside.</step>
            <step>Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl for the dumplings. Cut in cold butter until mixture is the texture of cornmeal. Stir in parsley and set aside.</step>
            <step>Shred cooled chicken and return to the pot. Taste the broth and adjust the seasoning if needed. Add peas and green beans. Stir in the flour-butter paste. Select Saute function to bring broth back to a boil.</step>
            <step>Pour buttermilk into the dumpling mixture and stir until combined. Drop the dumpling dough by heaping spoonfuls on top of the stew; a small cookie scoop works well.</step>
            <step>Cover pot with the lid, leaving the steam vent open. Select Slow Cooker function and simmer on Low, covered, until dumplings are cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes. A skewer inserted in the center of a dumpling should come out clean.</step>

            <ingredient>2 ½ pounds beef chuck</ingredient>
            <ingredient>2 teaspoons kosher salt</ingredient>

            <ingredient>⅔ cup white wine</ingredient>
            <ingredient>4 pounds yellow onions, sliced</ingredient>
            <ingredient>2 pounds red onions, sliced</ingredient>
            <ingredient>salt to taste</ingredient>
            <ingredient>2 (16 ounce) boxes uncooked rigatoni</ingredient>
            <ingredient>1 tablespoon chopped fresh marjoram leaves</ingredient>
            <ingredient>1 pinch cayenne pepper</ingredient>
            <ingredient>2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</ingredient>
        </ingredients>
        <steps>
            <step>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook pancetta until most of fat is rendered out, about 6 minutes. Remove cooked pancetta with a slotted spoon and save.</step>
            <step>Raise heat to high and transfer meat to the pot. Season with salt. Cook and stir until liquid releases from beef and begins to evaporate, and meat browns, 10 to 15 minutes.</step>
            <step>Reduce heat to medium-high. Add celery, carrots, reserved cooked pancetta, salt and pepper. Cook and stir about 5 minutes. Add a heaping tablespoon of tomato paste, bay leaf, and white wine. Cook and stir, scraping up the brownings from the bottom of the pan, 2 to 3 minutes. Add sliced onions. Reduce heat to medium. Cover pot and cook 30 minutes without stirring. After 30 minutes, stir onions and meat until well mixed. Cover again, and cook another 30 minutes. Stir.</step>
            <step>Reduce heat to low and cook uncovered 8 to 10 hours, stirring occasionally. Skim off fat as mixture cooks. If sauce seems to reduce too much, add water or broth as needed to maintain a sauce-like consistency. Cook until beef and onions seem to melt into each other.</step>
            <step>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until just barely al dente, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain.</step>
            <step>Add rigatoni to the sauce and cook until heated through. Serve topped with a pinch of marjoram and freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</step>

            <step>While the macaroni is boiling, melt the remaining butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the onions, and cook until the onions begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Stir in the flour, and cook 5 minutes longer. Add the milk and bring to a simmer, stirring frequently. Cook and stir until the milk has thickened, about 10 minutes. Once thick and smooth, stir in the salt, white pepper, Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce, mustard, 2 cups of Cheddar cheese, and 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese. Stir until the cheeses have melted, then stir in the macaroni until evenly coated. Scrape into the prepared baking dish, and smooth the top. Toss the remaining 1 cup Cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese with the dry bread crumbs in a mixing bowl. Sprinkle evenly over the top of the macaroni.</step>
            <step>Bake in the preheated oven until the macaroni is hot and the crust is golden brown, about 30 minutes.</step>

        </ingredients>
        <steps>
            <step>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease the sides of a 9-inch springform pan. Line the bottom with a circle of parchment paper.</step>
            <step>Crush biscuits into crumbs using a food processor. Stir crumbs, butter, confectioners' sugar, and salt together to make the crust. Press into the bottom of the pan. Rinse food processor and set aside for the cranberry glaze.</step>
            <step>Bake crust in the preheated oven until firm, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the crust from the oven and reduce the temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Let crust cool while making the filling.</step>
            <step>Beat cream cheese and sugar together until smooth. Add eggs, sour cream, vanilla, and orange zest. Mix until well combined, stopping to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl. Spoon batter over the crust.</step>
            <step>Bake until the filling is set but still soft in the center, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool cheesecake to room temperature, about 30 minutes.</step>
            <step>While the cheesecake is cooling, combine 1/3 cup sugar and water in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat and stir until sugar is dissolved. Pour into a bowl and cool for 10 minutes. Add cranberries and stir to coat with syrup.</step>
            <step>Refrigerate cheesecake and syrup-coated cranberries, 8 hours to overnight.</step>
            <step>Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Place 1/4 cup granulated sugar in a shallow bowl. Drain the cranberries, then roll them in the sugar. Place the sugared cranberries on the prepared baking sheet and allow to dry, 30 minutes to 1 hour.</step>
            <step>In the meantime, make the glaze. Combine cranberries, water, and sugar in a small saucepan. Simmer, crushing cranberries, until jammy, about 8 minutes. Let cool slightly. Transfer to the food processor; add confectioners' sugar, orange juice, corn syrup, vanilla, and salt. Process until smooth.</step>
            <step>Strain cranberry glaze through a fine-mesh sieve and discard solids. Pour over the cheesecake and smooth across the top with a small offset spatula. Garnish with sugared cranberries.</step>
